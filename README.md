# ATmega-Device-Drivers
Embededd System micrcontroller from microchip (Atmel) Hardware device drivers

this is general device drivers in pic16f and atmega32  

this drivers are made based on arm stm32 drivers 

drivers are made to be used on both pic16f and atmega32 can change between two microcontrollers using the identifier in main.h 

drivers for MCAL Layer ( GPIO - ADC - TIMERS - SPI - UART -PWM )
drivers for HAL Layer ( KeyPad - Switches - LEDs - RTClock -Motors )
